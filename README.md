## Setup
To make your own projects, clone the master branch and create another branch with your project name, no further installation required.

## Why
I mean, you could just use snippets. Yes, of course, you can. But then you're wasting precious time. There is a better way!

## Recommendations
Use it alongside a live web server. This way, every time you check out another branch, it will instantly change the project, it can be that simple!
